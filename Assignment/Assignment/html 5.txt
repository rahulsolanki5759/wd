Ans ->	SVG stands for Scalabe Vector Graphics. Canvas and svg is for 2D graphics.
	Canvas :  Raster based - composed of pixel.

		     Canvas can be modified through script only.

		     SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution.
		     SVG can be modified through script and CSS.
